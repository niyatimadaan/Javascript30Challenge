    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const tryCopy = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    tryCopy[2]='Rhea';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log("tryCopy ",tryCopy);

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log("players ",players);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const copy1 = players.slice();
    console.log("copy1 ",copy1);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const copy2 = [].concat(players);
    console.log("copy2 ",copy2);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copy3 = [...players];
    console.log("copy3 ",copy3);

    const copy4 = Array.from(players);
    console.log("copy4 ",copy4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    copy1[2] = 'Ryan';
    console.log("copy1 ",copy1);
    console.log("players ",players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
